## Branches and Issues

In this project there are only two types of branches:
- ___feature___
- ___fix___

Feature has to be connected with one Issue. Fix branch may or may not be connected with issue.

__Conventions__:
- __only__ english words
- branch name always starts with: ___feature/___ or ___fix/___
- use a __dash__ instead of space
- better when name of the branch is the same as issue name

__Example__:
- issue name: ___Setup backend project___
- branch name: ___feature/setup-backend-project___

# Server installation and startup

Firstly you need to install dotnet sdk (version 3.1.102) on your computer. You will find this in the link below:

Second step is two run the app in your favourite IDE or terminal. Personally I recommend to use Visual Studio Code with C# extension. Click run button in VS Code, and after this you can start consume data from WebAPI.
