## Branches and Issues

In this project there are only two types of branches:
- __feature__
- __fix__

Feature has to be connected with one Issue. Fix branch may or may not be connected with branch. __Conventions__:
- __only__ english words
- branch name always starts with: ___feature/___ or ___fix/___
- use a __dash__ instead of spaces
- better when name of the branch is the same as issue name

Example:
- issue name: __Setup backend project__
- branch name: __feature/setup-backend-project__

# Server installation and startup

Firstly you need to install dotnet sdk (version 3.1.102) on your computer. You will find this in the link below:

Second step is two run the app in your favourite IDE or terminal. Personally I recommend to use Visual Studio Code with C# extension. Click run button in VS Code, and after this you can start consume data from WebAPI.
